#	Italien Restaurant API

This is a University Project made with spring boot and H2 memory DataBase (most likely will be migrated to a Mysql DataBase when finished).
This API offers : 
	-It offers CRUD Operations for every entity.
	-It's really flexible because i made the services seprated so you can add anything you want.
	-I made the links methods between entities accordingly to their relation in the database for an exemple : In the client service you will find the function AddTicket that will create a ticket and fill it and add it to the client tickets set.
	-You can check the DataBase Scheme in the picture Called DATABASE.

Quick disclaimer : The attributes and other notations as well might be in French because it's imposed by our education system.
